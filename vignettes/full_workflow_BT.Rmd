# Intro

## Goal of the Vignette

This vignettes describes the full workflow of creating a codebook (or Skalenhandbuch) via the `eatCodebook` package. For illustrative purposes we use a small example data set which comes alongside the package and contains different types of variables (e.g., numeric, categorical, pooled variables, scales). We import the data set using the `eatGADS` package, which is automatically installed when `eatCodebook` is installed.

```{r eatcodebook setup}
library(eatCodebook)
file <- system.file("extdata", "example2_clean.sav", package = "eatCodebook")
dat <- eatGADS::import_spss(file)
```

The main function for creating a Skalenhandbuch or codebook is called `eatcodebook()`. It takes the input from several lists and data frames that you create throughout this vignette and converts them into one long object containing LaTeX code. You have to be mindful of special characters (like Î± and other Greek letters) in string input from the data frames as they might throw errors down the line. Also, formatting in Excel is lost in the LaTeX script, so you may need to add LaTeX code in the Excel files. The most common occurrences are mentioned in this vignette.

While working in the codebook, you will probably find some mismatches or errors in the data. You then have to recreate every data frame or Excel table you created so far, including the changes you made to those objects. This vignette contains examples how to write a script in R that you can just rerun in those cases, without having to redo a lot of work. 

The package `eatCodebook` was created with the codebook for the [IQB Bildungstrends](https://www.iqb.hu-berlin.de/bt/) in mind. Some use cases are specific to these Bildungstrends (BT) studies, but you can create a codebook for your own study with this vignette, as well. 


## What is a Codebook?

In order to answer research questions, research institutes collect a lot of data. Usually the data isn't used to answer all possible questions, but just the ones of interest to the study they were collected for. When people want to to do their own research, they can ask the institutes for the data.  
A codebook contains **all of the collected variables** of a study or data collection, including their instructions, relevant statistics, references, and more. With that you can see, whether data sets might help you answer the question you do research on, before asking for the data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setup

Before we start, we need to setup a proper work space. Creating a codebook takes a while and involves several files, so when you don't protocol your progress well, it's easy to lose focus. When editing the files in R, the script can get very long, so I recommend to use several .R documents to maintain an overview.

## create a new Repository

First set up a new private repository in the [`iqb-research` project](https://github.com/orgs/iqb-research/repositories) and use the template `SHB_Erstellung_Vorlage`. when you don't have access to this repository, ask the package developer for help. 

![](.\pictures\repo_template.png)

You now have all the .R templates that you need, but you might have to create the issues yourself. The To-dos should be apparent from this vignette or you can copy the issues from the template repo by hand. You find the following files:

## File Structure

There are several files and folders. The .R files contain example scripts and to-dos, that you need to adjust and add to. 

| R File | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `0SH_main.R` | The main file you work in. You can work with just this file and ignore the others, if you want. I recommend using this file for smaller changes and the separate files for more complex changes. With this file, you can create Excel files which you then have to edit manually or in R. |
| `1SH_kennwerte.R` | Create and edit the `inputForDescriptives` files. This might not be needed, when you don't have to adjust anything here. |
| `2SH_varinfo.R` | Create and edit the `varinfo` file. This file contains the core content of the codebook. `eatCodebook()` creates the table structure with variable names and labels on its own, but you have to add structure, references, instructions, etc.. |
| `3SH_gliederung.R` | The information read from `varinfo` is usually incomplete, so you have to add missing section names. |
| `4SH_literatur.R` | Create and edit the `reference` file. You have to match the short references to the long ones. You also have to add proper latex syntax for italic text or URLs. |
| `5SH_latex_intro.R` | A template to create a .tex file with latex syntax out of a a Word .docx document. You need this later when creating the intro. |
| `6SH_Erstellung_kurz.R` | A short script which can create a new codebook version after you created all the necessary Excel files.|

You need to make sure, that there are three folders and create them if not. 

| Folder | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `excel_files` | Here you save all of the created Excel files to save the progress. |
| `Latex` | Here you save the .tex files and pdfs of the finished latex script for the codebook. You can add the folder `archive` to keep different versions to compare. |
| `Texte` | Here you can save the intro text or cover, etc. |

Pull the repo and start with the file `0SH_main.R`. You usually don't need to copy any code from this vignette, because the template already contains example code lines that you can copy or adjust.

## Packages

You need to make sure you have the latest package versions installed. The packages you need are usually at the top of the files in `setup`. To save time you can install them before you start your work.

```{r packages, eval=FALSE}
# main
remotes::install_github("beckerbenj/eatCodebook")
library(eatCodebook)
remotes::install_github("beckerbenj/eatGADS")
library(eatGADS)
# varinfo
remotes::install_github("weirichs/eatTools")
library(eatTools)
# references
install.packages("tidyxl")
library(tidyxl)
# latex_intro
install.packages("readtext")
library(readtext)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Import Data

The first step is the data import. 

## About the Data

The BT studies usually have several SPSS data files (`.sav`) that you can import with `import_spss()`, but you can also import `.RDS` files with `readRDS()`. If you work with Github, the data sets are probably too large to upload to Github, so they would need to be stored locally.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment you need to have at least **two data sets**, otherwise the function `codebook()` won't work.  
> The same variable name cannot be used more than once across the data sets. 

The data sets can be stored in `GADSdat` objects, containing two data frames: one for the variables and the actual data, the other contains the meta data or labels for the variables. 

### Order of the Data Sets

You have to save all the data sets in one list that also determines the order in which the variables are displayed in the codebook. It's best to choose the order you want it to have later right away, so you don't have to rerun the script later. 

> [!NOTE]
> The BT data sets are usually ordered like this: 
>
> - **data_sus**: student questionnaire
> - **data_lfb_allg**: general teacher questionnaire
> - **data_lfb_spez**: learngroup specific teacher questionnaire
> - **data_slfb**: school administration questionnaire
> - **data_match**: data to match different data sets
> - **data_linking**: data to link different data sets


## Data Import To-do

### Import the Data

Either use `import_spss()` for .sav (SPSS) files or `readRDS()` to import each data set separately, you just need a string with your local file path. Name them in a meaningful manner. Here you have an example syntax, where you would need to add/adjust the proper file name.  

```{r data import, eval=FALSE}
data_sus      <- eatGADS::import_spss("Q:\\filepath\\Daten_sus.sav")
data_lfb_allg <- eatGADS::import_spss("Q:\\filepath\\Daten_lfb_allg.sav")
data_lfb_spez <- eatGADS::import_spss("Q:\\filepath\\Daten_lfb_spez.sav")
data_slfb     <- eatGADS::import_spss("Q:\\filepath\\Daten_slfb.sav")
```

### Save Data in a List

After importing the data, you need to save it in one list. The order determines the order in which they are displayed in the codebook. The names should be consistent throughout. 

```{r datenliste, eval=FALSE}
datalist <- list(sus = data_sus,
                 lfb_allg = data_lfb_allg, lfb_spez = data_lfb_spez,
                 slfb = data_slfb)
```

## 2. Descriptive Statistics

For each imported data set, you create a new object with `createInputForDescriptives` containing important descriptive information about the each variables like their name, label, format information for the pdf in the end, scale level or which variables are grouped together. You name them according to you data sets like `descriptives_sus` or `descriptives_lfb`.

```{r creating input for descriptives, eval=FALSE}
descriptives_sus <- createInputForDescriptives(GADSdat = daten_sus, nCatsForOrdinal = 4)
```

Then you save each `descriptives` object in its own Excel file. For that you create a new folder in your repo called `excel_files` and use following code. All the file paths for files within your repo should already be correct in the script, you just need to adjust the file names when you copy and paste the code for the other data sets.

```{r saving descriptives, eval=FALSE}
writeExcel(descriptives_sus, ".\\excel_files\\descriptives_sus.xlsx")
```

Now you have to check, whether everything is the way you need it to be. If not, you have to either make changes in the Excel file manually and save your changes under `descriptives_dat_bearbeitet.xlsx`, so you don't need to recreate the original Excel later if needed; or you can check and edit the file in RStudio (see below). For a detailed explanation on how the `input for descriptives` is supposed to look like, see [here](https://beckerbenj.github.io/eatCodebook/articles/full_workflow.html#descriptive-statistics).

After you made the changes, you read in your edited file and store it in a new object. The `getinputForDescriptives` function checks whether the data has the right format, as well. If it doesn't, it will tell you. For some data sets you need to check for `scale consistency`, that is whether the grouping of variables that belong to the same scale matches in both the data set itself and the created descriptive file. Then you need to create a `kennwerte` object with `calculateDescriptives`, again for each data set. The syntax might look like this:

```{r check scale and kennwerte, eval=FALSE}
# read in edited Excel file
descriptives_sus_bearbeitet <- getInputForDescriptives(".\\excel_files\\descriptives_sus_bearbeitet.xlsx")
# optional: check for scale consistency
check_scale_sus <- checkScaleConsistency(daten_sus, descriptives_sus_bearbeitet, 1:nrow(descriptives_sus_bearbeitet))
# create Kennwerte object
kennwerte_sus <- calculateDescriptives(GADSdat = daten_sus, inputForDescriptives = descriptives_sus_bearbeitet, showCallOnly = FALSE)
```

After you created the `inputForDescriptives` and `kennwerte` for each data set, you again store them in two separate lists, analog to `datenliste`. Then you save these two lists as an .RDS file and read them in again with `readRDS`. You don't create a new folder, but put them in the `excel_files` folder as well.

```{r save inputForDescriptices and kennwerte, eval=FALSE}
# create two lists
kennwerte <- list(sus = kennwerte_sus,
                  lfb = kennwerte_lfb)
input_descriptives <- list(sus = descriptives_sus_bearbeitet,
                           lfb = descriptives_lfb_bearbeitet)
# save files
saveRDS(kennwerte, ".\\excel_files\\kennwerte.RDS")
saveRDS(input_descriptives, ".\\excel_files\\input_descriptives.RDS")
# load files
kennwerte <- readRDS(".\\excel_files\\kennwerte.RDS")
input_descriptives <- readRDS(".\\excel_files\\input_descriptives.RDS")
```

### Editing `InputForDescriptives` in R

Depending on how much you need to adjust you can make changes in the `SH_main.R` file or switch to `SH_kennwerte.R`. The latter has some example code for typical changes, like adjusting the input for `descriptives$scale` or `descriptives$type`.

Sometimes `createInputForDescriptives` creates a different scale level for variables that they actually have. The column `scale` is later important for how the variable is shown in the finished Skalenhandbuch. For example when variables get the scale `nominal`, when they should have `ordinal`.

You can adjust that by extracting all relevant variables, for instance by name, using `grep`, to identify the position of all variables that start with a certain name in `descriptives_sus`. Sometimes you need to recreate the descriptives objects/files and the position might change, but usually not the variables that are affected. In this case you wouldn't have to adjust your code and can just rerun it. With the position of the affected variables, you can make changes for all affected variables at the same time.

```{r editing descriptives1, eval=FALSE}
# extracting the position of variables Lname_a - Lname_d
pos <- grep("Lname", descriptives_sus$varName)
# adjusting the input for the column `scale`
descriptives_sus$scale[pos] <- "ordinal"
```

Some variables represent a scale, others the items belonging to that scale, see [here](https://beckerbenj.github.io/eatCodebook/articles/full_workflow.html#scale-variables-with-individual-items) for more information about that. In order for that to be displayed correctly later, you might need to adjust the `type` column. The scale needs the label `scale`, the items the label `item`. The code below shows you how to identify the scale item - which is usually labeled correctly - and how to identify and edit the label for the items.

```{r editing descriptives2, eval=FALSE}
# identifying the scale variable
group <- descriptives_eins[descriptives_eins$type == "scale",]$group
# adjusting the item varaibles
for(var in group){
  descriptives_eins[descriptives_eins$group == var & descriptives_eins$type == "variable",]$type <- "item" 
}
```

When you're done with making changes, you can save them in a new Excel file like before.

```{r saving descriptives2, eval=FALSE}
writeExcel(descriptives_sus, ".\\excel_files\\descriptives_sus_bearbeitet.xlsx")
```

## 3. Missings

You need to create one `missings.xlsx` Excel file for all the data sets combined. You need the two lists containing the data sets themselves (`datenliste`) and the created input for descriptives (`input_descriptives`). You just create the object, save it as an Excel file and read it in with `getMissings`. Usually you don't need to edit the missings file.

```{r missings, eval=FALSE}
# creating the object
missings <- createMissings(datenliste, input_descriptives)
# save as an Excel file
write_xlsx(df_list = missings, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\missings.xlsx")
# read in Excel file and check for right format
missings <- getMissings(".\\excel_files\\missings.xlsx")
```

## 4. Scales

You need to create one `skalen.xlsx` Excel file for all the data sets combined. It contains the info which variables are scaled items. You just need the list `input_descriptives` for that. Usually you don't need to edit the skalen file.

```{r skalen, eval=FALSE}
# creating the object
skalen <- createScaleInfo(input_descriptives)
# save as an Excel file
write_xlsx(df_list = skalen, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\skalen.xlsx")
# read in Excel file and check for right format
skalen <- getScaleInfo(".\\excel_files\\skalen.xlsx")
```

When `getScaleInfo` doesn't throw an error, you should look at the object `skalen` anyway to make sure it contains all scaled items, i.e. all scale variables and their item variables. If the scales aren't displayed correctly, there's usually an error in `input_descriptives`, for instance when the scaled items aren't labeled correctly.

```{r checking skalen, eval=FALSE}
View(skalen)
```

## 5. Abbreviation List/AbkÃ¼rzungsverzeichnis

You create either a template object for the abbreviation list or read in the one from last year's BT and call it `abbr_list`, and save it in a new Excel file. The file has two sets of abbreviations: `Akronyme` and `statistische Formelzeichen`, that each get their own Excel sheet/list object.

```{r abbr_list, eval=FALSE}
# new object, without input
abbr_list <- createAbbrList()
# read in abbr_list from last BT 
abbr_list <- getExcel("Q:\\filepath\\abkuerzung.xlsx")
# save in Excel
write_xlsx(df_list = abbr_list, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\abkuerzung.xlsx")
```

You can add or delete entries in R like with any other data.frame that is saved in a list. LaTeX can't display Greek characters when you just use the letter by itself. You might need to adjust the spelling. `$\alpha$` is LaTeX code and should be printed like the image shows.

```{r edit abbr_list 1, eval=FALSE}
# add/edit entries in abbr_list
abbr_list$`Statistische Formelzeichen`$Symbol[1] <- "$\alpha$"
abbr_list$`Statistische Formelzeichen`$Bedeutung[1] <- "cronbachs Alpha"
```

![](.\pictures\abbr_list_alpha.png)

When the Excel file from past BTs has commentary/extra columns in it, you can't use the function `makeAbbrList`. To make sure you only the have two columns per sheet/data frame, you can save just the first two columns per sheet in your `abbr_list` object. After that you need to save the changes to Excel.

```{r edit abbr_list 2, eval=FALSE}
# edit abbr_list
abbr_list$Akronyme <- abbr_list21$Akronyme[,1:2]
abbr_list$`Statistische Formelzeichen` <- abbr_list21$`Statistische Formelzeichen`[,1:2]
# save in Excel
write_xlsx(df_list = abbr_list, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\abkuerzung.xlsx")
```

When you have all the abbreviations, you can create the LaTeX code that you need directly from the Excel file.

```{r abbr_list2, eval=FALSE}
# creates LaTeX syntax
abbr_list <- makeAbbrList(".\\excel_files\\abkuerzung.xlsx")
```

## 6. Varinfo

Creating and editing the `varinfo.xlsx` file/object is the main work of creating the Skalenhandbuch. This objects contains all information about the variables, their order and structure, as well as their references, instructions, remarks or information about the background model, as you can see [here](https://beckerbenj.github.io/eatCodebook/articles/full_workflow.html#variable-information). There is only one object/Excel file overall, but each data set has its own sheet, so you can edit them separately.

### varinfo setup

The setup is quite simple, you can do that in `SH_main.R`. You first create a varinfo object from the SPSS data list you read in at the beginning (`datenliste`) and from the input for descriptives list you created out of that (`input_descriptives`). It contains all variables for each data set and columns that you need, but you still need to add a lot of information from other files.

Then you add layout information for each variable. And save to Excel `varinfo.xlsx` as a backup or template, and `varinfo_bearbeitet.xlsx` as the file you actually work with. The you read in the created Excel and check the format with `getVarInfo`.

```{r varinfo setup, eval=FALSE}
# creating varinfo object
varinfo <- createVarInfo(datenliste, input_descriptives)
# Layout
varinfo <- inferLayout(varinfo, datenliste, input_descriptives)

# save to Excel
write_xlsx(df_list = varinfo, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\varinfo.xlsx")
write_xlsx(df_list = varinfo, row.names = FALSE, filePath = ".\\excel_files\\varinfo_bearbeitet.xlsx")
# checking format
varinfo <- getVarInfo(".\\excel_files\\varinfo.xlsx")
```

With this, the setup is complete and I recommend to switch to `SH_varinfo.R`, so your main script doesn't get too long and you lose overview. You need to add the following information. The order in which you add them is up to you.

| Column in Varinfo | Where to get the Information from | Order |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `QuelleSH` and `Instruktionen` | Both usually in the same file under `Q:/filepath/04_Instruktionen_Quellen`, one Excel file per data set | usually like SPSS files |
| `Gliederung` and `Unterteilung.im.Skalenhandbuch` | Often in one file called `Reihenfolge_Variable_final.xlsx` or similar, contains one sheet per data set | different from SPSS files |
| `rekodiert` | Info in the variable name: all with `_r` at the end | no order |
| `Hintergrundmodell`, `HGM.Reihenfolge` and `HGM.Variable.erstellt.aus` | in an extra Excel file, you probably have to ask about it | no order |
| optional: `Anmerkung.Var` | in an file on Q: | check order |

The order of the variables in `varinfo` depends on the order from the SPSS files. However, the order of the variables files the BT-Team provides for you might be different. The files for `Quellen` and `Gliederung` usually contain all variables, whereas for the backgroundmodel/HGM or `rekodiert` you have to change the input for individual variables, so the order is not relevant.

I recommend starting with the files that have the same order as the original varinfo, so you only have to change the variable order once. For this vignette I'll just describe the procedure for one data set.
